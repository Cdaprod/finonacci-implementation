# Fibonacci Implementations

This is to help you understand dynamic programming (DP), which is a powerful algorithmic technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

Let's start with a simple but illustrative example - the Fibonacci sequence calculation - to demonstrate the key concepts of DP.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Let me explain the key concepts of dynamic programming:

1. **Core Principles**:
   - Break down a problem into smaller subproblems
   - Store solutions to avoid redundant calculations
   - Build the final solution using stored results

2. **Two Main Approaches**:
   - Top-down (Memoization): Start with the main problem and recursively solve subproblems
   - Bottom-up (Tabulation): Start with smallest subproblems and build up to the final solution

3. **When to Use DP**:
   - Problem has overlapping subproblems
   - Optimal substructure (optimal solution can be built from optimal solutions of subproblems)
   - Usually involves finding an optimal value (minimum, maximum, count)
